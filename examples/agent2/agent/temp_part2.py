# Final Summary of Fixes and Improvements

# 1. Path Configuration Fixes
# - Changed OUTPUT_PATH to use WEBSITE_OUTPUT_PATH environment variable instead of OUTPUT_PATH
# - Fixed default path to use "/tmp/generated_flask_website" instead of "generated_website"
# - Ensured paths are properly configured for cross-platform compatibility

# 2. Extension Handling Fixes
# - Added logic to avoid duplicating file extensions (.py.py, .html.html, .css.css, etc.)
# - Fixed handling of special component names like "style" and "script"
# - Improved the classification logic for determining where files should be stored
# - Added special case handling for CSS and JS files based on naming conventions

# 3. Route Registration and Serving Fixes
# - Updated route registration to use the same improved logic for determining file paths
# - Added improved MIME type detection for static files based on extensions
# - Fixed the /generated route to properly serve the generated website's content
# - Added proper handling of static files in the generated website
# - Modified templates to ensure correct path resolution for static resources

# 4. Additional Improvements
# - Added better error handling for missing components
# - Added a "Save Components & Refresh" button to the interface
# - Made the interface more user-friendly with clearer information
# - Fixed path-related security issues with proper validation

# Complete changes:
# 1. Changed environment variable configuration:
#    ENGRAMDB_PATH = os.environ.get("ENGRAMDB_PATH", "agent_memory.engramdb")
#    OUTPUT_PATH = os.environ.get("OUTPUT_PATH", "generated_website")
#    to:
#    ENGRAMDB_PATH = os.environ.get("ENGRAMDB_PATH", "agent_memory.engramdb")
#    OUTPUT_PATH = os.environ.get("WEBSITE_OUTPUT_PATH", "/tmp/generated_flask_website")

# 2. Fixed file extension handling in save_files_to_disk() to avoid duplicates:
#    - Now checks if a filename already has an extension before adding one
#    - Special handling for "style" -> CSS and "script" -> JS files
#    - Better MIME type detection for various file types

# 3. Updated the /generated route to directly serve the generated website:
#    - Now reads the actual HTML template from disk
#    - Adjusts paths for static resources
#    - Properly handles routes defined in the generated app

# 4. Created helper utility that demonstrates all the fixes:
#    - temp_part1.py: Simple test script that demonstrates the fixed functionality
#    - temp_fixed.py: Test script for file path handling

# How to test the fixes:
# 1. Run the modified flask_website_generator.py
# 2. Create a website using the generator interface
# 3. Click "View Generated Website" to see the actual generated site
# 4. Files will be properly saved to /tmp/generated_flask_website with correct extensions
