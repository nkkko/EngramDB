# Storage Engines

EngramDB supports multiple storage backends to accommodate different use cases. This document explains the available storage engines and how to use them effectively.

## Overview of Storage Engines

EngramDB provides two main storage engines:

1. **Memory Storage Engine**: Volatile in-memory storage for testing and development
2. **File Storage Engine**: Persistent file-based storage for production use

The storage engine is responsible for:

- Saving memory nodes
- Loading memory nodes
- Deleting memory nodes
- Listing all available memory nodes

## Memory Storage Engine

The Memory Storage Engine stores all data in RAM, making it fast but volatile. It's ideal for:

- Development and testing
- Short-lived applications
- Scenarios where persistence isn't required

### Creating a Memory Storage Engine

#### Rust Example

```rust
use engramdb::{Database, MemoryNode};

// Create an in-memory database
let mut db = Database::in_memory();
println!("Created in-memory database");
```

#### Python Example

```python
import engramdb

# Create an in-memory database
db = engramdb.Database.in_memory()
print("Created in-memory database")
```

### Characteristics

- **Speed**: Very fast operations
- **Persistence**: None (data is lost when the application terminates)
- **Scalability**: Limited by available RAM
- **Concurrency**: Not thread-safe by default

## File Storage Engine

The File Storage Engine stores data on disk, providing persistence. It's suitable for:

- Production applications
- Long-lived data
- Scenarios where data must survive application restarts

### Creating a File Storage Engine

#### Rust Example

```rust
use engramdb::{Database, DatabaseConfig};

// Method 1: Using file_based constructor
let mut db = Database::file_based("./my_database")?;

// Method 2: Using DatabaseConfig
let config = DatabaseConfig {
    use_memory_storage: false,
    storage_dir: Some("./my_database".to_string()),
    cache_size: 100,
};

let mut db = Database::new(config)?;

// Initialize to load existing memories
db.initialize()?;
```

#### Python Example

```python
import engramdb
import os

# Create directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs("./my_database", exist_ok=True)

# Method 1: Using file_based constructor
db = engramdb.Database.file_based("./my_database")

# Method 2: Using DatabaseConfig
config = engramdb.DatabaseConfig(
    use_memory_storage=False,
    storage_dir="./my_database",
    cache_size=100
)

db = engramdb.Database(config)

# Initialize to load existing memories
db.initialize()
```

### Characteristics

- **Speed**: Slower than memory storage but still efficient
- **Persistence**: Data survives application restarts
- **Scalability**: Limited by available disk space
- **Concurrency**: Basic file locking for safety

### File Storage Structure

The File Storage Engine organizes data as follows:

```
storage_dir/
├── memories/
│   ├── 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000.json
│   ├── 234e5678-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001.json
│   └── ...
├── index/
│   ├── vector_index.json
│   └── ...
└── metadata/
    └── db_info.json
```

Each memory node is stored as a separate JSON file, named by its UUID.

## Choosing a Storage Engine

Consider these factors when choosing a storage engine:

| Factor | Memory Storage | File Storage |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Speed | Very fast | Moderate |
| Persistence | None | Yes |
| Memory Usage | High | Low to moderate |
| Durability | None | Good |
| Use Case | Development, testing | Production |

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the database configuration:

```rust
let config = DatabaseConfig {
    use_memory_storage: false,
    storage_dir: Some("./custom_path".to_string()),
    cache_size: 500, // Larger cache for better performance
};

let mut db = Database::new(config)?;
```

### Initialization

When using file storage, you should initialize the database to load existing memories into the vector index:

```rust
// Create the database
let mut db = Database::file_based("./my_database")?;

// Initialize to load existing memories
db.initialize()?;

// Now the vector index is populated and ready for similarity search
let results = db.search_similar(&query_vector, 5, 0.0)?;
```

### Migrating Between Storage Engines

You can migrate data from one storage engine to another:

```rust
// Source database (in-memory)
let mut source_db = Database::in_memory();

// Add some memories to the source
// ...

// Target database (file-based)
let mut target_db = Database::file_based("./migrated_data")?;

// Migrate all memories
for id in source_db.list_all()? {
    let memory = source_db.load(id)?;
    target_db.save(&memory)?;
}

println!("Migration complete");
```

## Implementation Details

### StorageEngine Trait

Both storage engines implement the `StorageEngine` trait:

```rust
pub trait StorageEngine: Send {
    fn save(&mut self, node: &MemoryNode) -> Result<()>;
    fn load(&self, id: Uuid) -> Result<MemoryNode>;
    fn delete(&mut self, id: Uuid) -> Result<()>;
    fn list_all(&self) -> Result<Vec<Uuid>>;
}
```

This trait defines the core operations that any storage engine must support.

### Memory Storage Implementation

The Memory Storage Engine uses a simple HashMap to store memory nodes:

```rust
pub struct MemoryStorageEngine {
    memories: HashMap<Uuid, MemoryNode>,
}
```

### File Storage Implementation

The File Storage Engine serializes memory nodes to JSON files:

```rust
pub struct FileStorageEngine {
    base_dir: PathBuf,
    memories_dir: PathBuf,
    index_dir: PathBuf,
    metadata_dir: PathBuf,
}
```

## Best Practices

### Memory Storage

- Use for development, testing, and ephemeral applications
- Be aware that all data will be lost when the application terminates
- Monitor memory usage for large datasets

### File Storage

- Use for production applications where persistence is required
- Always call `initialize()` after creating a file-based database
- Implement regular backups of the storage directory
- Consider file system performance characteristics

### General Recommendations

- Choose the appropriate storage engine based on your requirements
- Initialize file-based databases to load existing memories
- Implement error handling for storage operations
- Consider implementing a custom storage engine for specialized needs

## Future Storage Engines

Future versions of EngramDB may include additional storage engines:

- **Database Storage Engine**: Integration with SQL or NoSQL databases
- **Distributed Storage Engine**: Support for clustered deployments
- **Encrypted Storage Engine**: Enhanced security for sensitive data
- **Tiered Storage Engine**: Automatic migration between hot and cold storage

## Conclusion

EngramDB's flexible storage engine architecture allows you to choose the right storage solution for your needs. Whether you need the speed of in-memory storage for development or the persistence of file-based storage for production, EngramDB provides the tools to manage your agent memories effectively.
