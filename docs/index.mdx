# Welcome to EngramDB Documentation

EngramDB is a specialized database system designed specifically for agent memory management. It provides efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of agent memories using a unified memory representation model.

## What is EngramDB?

EngramDB is a database system that combines vector, graph, and temporal properties in a single primitive called a MemoryNode. This unified approach allows for rich, multi-dimensional representation of agent memories, enabling complex queries that can leverage semantic similarity, relational connections, and temporal evolution.

## Why EngramDB?

Traditional databases are not optimized for the unique requirements of agent memory systems:

- **Vector databases** excel at similarity search but lack graph capabilities
- **Graph databases** handle relationships well but aren't optimized for vector similarity
- **Document databases** provide flexible schemas but lack specialized memory features
- **Time-series databases** track changes over time but aren't designed for semantic search
