# Introduction to EngramDB

EngramDB is a specialized database system designed specifically for agent memory management. It provides efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of agent memories using a unified memory representation model.

## What is an Engram?

In neuroscience, an engram is a hypothetical means by which memory traces are stored as biophysical or biochemical changes in the brain. EngramDB borrows this concept to represent agent memories as rich, multi-dimensional data structures that combine:

- **Vector embeddings** for semantic content
- **Graph connections** for relational information
- **Temporal layers** for memory evolution
- **Flexible attributes** for structured metadata

## Why EngramDB?

Traditional databases are not optimized for the unique requirements of agent memory systems:

- **Vector databases** excel at similarity search but lack graph capabilities
- **Graph databases** handle relationships well but aren't optimized for vector similarity
- **Document databases** provide flexible schemas but lack specialized memory features
- **Time-series databases** track changes over time but aren't designed for semantic search

EngramDB combines the strengths of these different database types into a unified system specifically designed for agent memory management.

## Key Use Cases

EngramDB is ideal for:

- **AI Agents**: Store and retrieve memories for conversational agents, assistants, and autonomous systems
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Build semantic knowledge graphs with vector similarity capabilities
- **Memory Evolution**: Track how knowledge and beliefs change over time
- **Multi-modal Memory**: Store and query memories across different modalities (text, images, etc.)
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Implement memory systems for cognitive architectures

## Core Features

- **Unified Memory Representation**: Combines graph, vector, and temporal properties in a single primitive
- **Vector Similarity Search**: Find memories with similar semantic content
- **Flexible Storage Options**: In-memory database for testing and development, file-based for persistence
- **Query API**: Rich querying with vector similarity, attribute filters, and temporal constraints
- **Memory Evolution**: Track changes to memories over time with temporal layers
- **Python Bindings**: First-class Python API for integration with ML and AI applications
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based UI for visualization and interaction with the database

## Architecture

EngramDB is built around these core components:

1. **MemoryNode**: The fundamental unit of storage, combining vector embeddings, graph connections, temporal layers, and flexible attributes
2. **Storage Engines**: Both in-memory and file-based storage options
3. **Vector Index**: For efficient similarity search
4. **Query System**: A fluent interface for building complex queries
5. **Database**: A unified interface combining all components
6. **Language Bindings**: Core implementation in Rust with Python bindings
