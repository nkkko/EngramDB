# TODO Style Guide

## Format Rules

- Use `[ ]` for incomplete tasks: `- [ ] Task description`
- Use `[x]` for completed tasks: `- [x] Task description`
- All tasks must have a priority marker: `[P0]`, `[P1]`, `[P2]`, or `[P3]`
  - `[P0]`: Critical - Must be done immediately
  - `[P1]`: High - Required for next milestone
  - `[P2]`: Medium - Important but not blocking
  - `[P3]`: Low - Nice to have

## Task Description Style
- Begin with an action verb in imperative form (e.g., "Add", "Implement", "Create")
- Be specific and concise
- Include acceptance criteria when appropriate
- For complex tasks, add sub-tasks with indentation

## Organization
- Group tasks by feature area or component
- Use headings (## for major sections, ### for subsections)
- Order tasks within sections by priority
- Move completed tasks to a "Completed" section with date

## Examples
```
- [x] [P1] Add basic vector search functionality (completed 2023-04-01)
- [ ] [P0] Fix memory leak in vector index when handling large embeddings
- [ ] [P1] Implement transaction support
  - [ ] Add begin_transaction() API
  - [ ] Add rollback functionality
  - [ ] Add commit functionality
