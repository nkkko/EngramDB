# The Memory Crisis in Agentic AI

- **ðŸ¤– "What was I doing again?"** â€“ Agents suffer from short-term memory loss when context exceeds limits
  - *"Users of Claude Code notice the AI forgets files previously discussed as sessions grow longer"*

---

# The Memory Crisis in Agentic AI

- **ðŸ§  Current Memory Hacks = Inefficient Band-aids**
  - Long contexts slow down and cost a fortune (quadratic scaling: 10Ã— context = 100Ã— cost)
  - Memory summarization leads to critical information loss

---

# The Memory Crisis in Agentic AI


- **ðŸ’¡ Existing Memory Tools Fall Short**
  - Vector DBs: Semantic search without relationships between memories
  - Graph DBs: Relationships without vector semantics
  - No solution combines both for efficient agent memory

# The Agent Memory Problem: Why It Matters

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Pain Points
- **Context-Window Pressure** - Agents hit limits & degrade
- **Limited Persistence** - Restarting loses all history
- **Inefficient Token Usage** - Context stuffing wastes budget
- **No Structured Memory** - Just flat collections of text
- **Multi-Agent Isolation** - No memory sharing across agents

</div>
<div>

### Real-World Examples
- Claude Code introduces `/compact` command - clear sign of context limitations
- Feature requests for "Advanced Memory Tool for Claude Code"
- LangChain & LlamaIndex offer vector stores but no graph integration
- Agents routinely forget their own reasoning and have to restart

</div>
</div>

# Why Long Contexts Aren't Enough

<div class="columns">
<div>

- **Quadratic Scaling Costs** - 2Ã— tokens = 4Ã— compute/memory
  - *"You're wasting computation to essentially do a Ctrl+F through irrelevant data"* - IBM Research

- **Diminishing Returns** - Beyond certain point, more context causes plateau or accuracy decline
  - *"Loss in the middle"* phenomenon where important information gets buried

</div>
<div>

- **Not Real-Time Friendly** - Ultra-long contexts introduce unacceptable latency
  - *"Not practical for real-time applications"* - Memory retrieval is faster

- **Unstructured Blob vs. Database** - No way to query specific information
  - Memory databases retrieve in milliseconds what an LLM takes seconds to process

</div>

# Vector Indexing Capabilities

- **HNSW Algorithm** for fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Hybrid indexing** combining exact and approximate methods
- **Customizable similarity functions** for domain-specific use cases
- **Memory-efficient storage** through product quantization
- **Scalable** to handle millions of embeddings

```rust
// Configurable indexing
db.configure_index()
   .vector_algorithm(VectorAlgorithm::HNSW)
   .with_parameters(HNSWParams {
       m: 16,                 // Maximum connections per node
       ef_construction: 100,  // Size of dynamic candidate list
       ef: 10,                // Size of dynamic list during search
   })
   .build()?;
```

---

# Engineered for AI Memory

- **Engrams**: Rich data units with vectors, metadata, and connections
- **Temporal layers**: Track memory evolution over time
- **Custom query language** for complex memory retrieval
- **Connection-based reasoning** using graph relationships

```
# Example query language:
FIND MEMORIES
SIMILAR TO [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2] WITH SIMILARITY > 0.7
WHERE attribute.category = "meeting" AND attribute.importance > 0.8
CREATED WITHIN LAST 7 DAYS
CONNECTED TO "d8f7a2e5-1c3b-4a6d-9e8f-5b7a2c3d1e0f" BY "Association"
LIMIT 10
```

# Agent-Friendly API

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Rust Example
```rust
// Create a memory node with embedding
let memory = MemoryNode::new(vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]);
memory.set_attribute("type", "conversation");
memory.set_attribute("importance", 0.8);

// Save to database
db.save(&memory)?;

// Retrieve similar memories
let results = db.query()
    .similar_to(&memory.vector, 0.7)
    .with_attribute("type", "conversation")
    .limit(5)
    .execute()?;
```

</div>
<div>

### Python Example
```python
# Create a memory node with embedding
memory = MemoryNode([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
memory.set_attribute("type", "conversation")
memory.set_attribute("importance", 0.8)

# Save to database
db.save(memory)

# Retrieve similar memories
results = db.query()\
    .similar_to(memory.vector, 0.7)\
    .with_attribute("type", "conversation")\
    .limit(5)\
    .execute()
```

</div>
</div>
