# **EngramDB**
## A purpose-built graph vector database for AI agent memory

![bg right:40% 90%](/Users/nikola/dev/engramdb/assets/logo/light.svg)

---

# The Problem

- **Current agentic AI systems lack effective memory mechanisms**
- Vector databases are not optimized for agent use cases
- LLM applications need efficient knowledge storage and retrieval
- Existing solutions don't balance performance with developer ergonomics

---
# Why Agent Memory Matters

- **Limited Context Window**: Agents only "see" 10-20K tokens of context at any time
- **Discontinuous Perception**: As Barry Zhang from Anthropic notes, agents operate with "lethal phases" between actions
- **Memory Persistence**: EngramDB bridges these gaps with durable, contextual memory
- **Budget Constraints**: Memory retrieval reduces token usage vs. repeated context stuffing
- **Error Recovery**: Persistent memory enables agents to resume after failures

# Thinking Like Your Agent

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Agent Challenges
- Limited to what's in context window
- "Closing eyes" between actions
- No persistent understanding
- Expensive context repetition
- Difficulty with complex state tracking

</div>
<div>

### EngramDB Solutions
- Rich temporal memory layers
- Connection-based reasoning
- Budget-aware memory retrieval
- Efficient state persistence
- Tool execution history storage

</div>
</div>

> "Everything that the model knows about the current state of the world is going to be explained in that 10 to 20k tokens." - Barry Zhang

# Vector Indexing Capabilities

- **HNSW Algorithm** for fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Hybrid indexing** combining exact and approximate methods
- **Customizable similarity functions** for domain-specific use cases
- **Memory-efficient storage** through product quantization
- **Scalable** to handle millions of embeddings

```rust
// Configurable indexing
db.configure_index()
   .vector_algorithm(VectorAlgorithm::HNSW)
   .with_parameters(HNSWParams {
       m: 16,                 // Maximum connections per node
       ef_construction: 100,  // Size of dynamic candidate list
       ef: 10,                // Size of dynamic list during search
   })
   .build()?;
```

---

# Engineered for AI Memory

- **Engrams**: Rich data units with vectors, metadata, and connections
- **Temporal layers**: Track memory evolution over time
- **Custom query language** for complex memory retrieval
- **Connection-based reasoning** using graph relationships

```
# Example query language:
FIND MEMORIES
SIMILAR TO [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2] WITH SIMILARITY > 0.7
WHERE attribute.category = "meeting" AND attribute.importance > 0.8
CREATED WITHIN LAST 7 DAYS
CONNECTED TO "d8f7a2e5-1c3b-4a6d-9e8f-5b7a2c3d1e0f" BY "Association"
LIMIT 10
```

# Agent-Friendly API

<div class="columns">
<div>

### Rust Example
```rust
// Create a memory node with embedding
let memory = MemoryNode::new(vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]);
memory.set_attribute("type", "conversation");
memory.set_attribute("importance", 0.8);

// Save to database
db.save(&memory)?;

// Retrieve similar memories
let results = db.query()
    .similar_to(&memory.vector, 0.7)
    .with_attribute("type", "conversation")
    .limit(5)
    .execute()?;
```

</div>
<div>

### Python Example
```python
# Create a memory node with embedding
memory = MemoryNode([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
memory.set_attribute("type", "conversation")
memory.set_attribute("importance", 0.8)

# Save to database
db.save(memory)

# Retrieve similar memories
results = db.query()\
    .similar_to(memory.vector, 0.7)\
    .with_attribute("type", "conversation")\
    .limit(5)\
    .execute()
```

</div>
